# Dashboard Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for the Dashboard. This README will walk you through the steps required to clone the repository and get the Dashboard running on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- Git
- Node.js
- Angular CLI

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Directory
First, you need to create or navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to navigate to your desired directory.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MaikRoth/msd-dashboard.git
```

This will create a copy of the repository in your current directory.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Repository Folder
Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the repository folder by running:

```
cd msd-dashboard
```

Replace `msd-dashboard` with the correct folder name if it's different.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
In the repository folder, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the required Node.js packages.

### Step 5: Run the Application
Finally, to start the Dashboard, run:

```
ng serve
```


This will start the Angular development server and the Dashboard should be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.
